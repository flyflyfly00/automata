Theory macros for Metapost:
===========================

I wrote these macros to make it easier to create diagrams of finite
automata (DFAs and NFAs), pushdown automata (PDAs), Turing machines,
etc.  I use LaTeX to prepare my slides and problem sets, and I
require my students to use LaTeX in writing up their solutions.

To get started, look at figure-examples.tex, which contains a few
basic examples.  For those conversent with LaTeX and Metapost, the
macros are based around the Metapost boxes package.  Simple wrappers
make it easier to create nodes with consistent sizing and to mark
start and accept nodes.

The edge command makes it easy to draw straight and curved edges
between nodes.  It also places labels intelligently, halfway between
the end nodes and adjusted so that larger labels do not overlap the
edge.

The example .tex file also shows how to use the emp LaTeX package,
which makes it convenient to write your figures inline with the rest
of the LaTeX code.  Between the example file and the comments in the
macros, the documentation is not great, but generally sufficient.
